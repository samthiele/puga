Structural analyses of the Puga Geothermal System, including (1) dilation-tendency analysis and (2) 2D FEM modelling of topographic stress

### *Dependencies*

To run the dilation tendency analyses, we assume a standard scientific python environment (numpy, matplotlib, scipy, pandas, etc. ) as well as
`mplstereonet`, which can be easily installed using pip:

`pip install mplstereonet`

The finite element notebook also requires:

1. a working copy of gmsh exposed to python via `pygmsh`: `pip install pygmsh`
2. scikit-fem: `pip install scikit-fem`
